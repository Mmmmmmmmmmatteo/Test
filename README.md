# 🧠 AI Mastery Journey: From Basics to Agentic AI

Welcome to my central repository. This space is a public learning log tracking my 16-week intensive roadmap to master Artificial Intelligence. My ultimate goal is to evolve from running basic local scripts to building robust "Production AI" and autonomous "AI Agents".

## 📚 Skills Acquired (Foundation)
* **Core Concepts:** Strong understanding of what AI is, along with its current limitations.
* **Programming:** Python syntax, logic, and basic data manipulation.
* **Version Control:** Managing projects through Git and GitHub.

## ⚙️ Current Focus (In Progress)
* **Data Manipulation:** Learning to extract, clean, and transform complex datasets using Pandas.
* **Mathematical Intuition:** Building a solid visual understanding of vectors, matrices, and gradients (Linear Algebra & Calculus) to properly debug deep models later.

## 🚀 Roadmap: Skills to be Implemented
As I progress through my learning path, I will build and upload projects focusing on these advanced areas:
1. **Applied ML & Evaluation:** Shifting focus from basic algorithms to Cross-Validation and robust metrics (F1-Score, Precision/Recall).
2. **Generative AI & RAG:** Building an Enterprise Document Assistant that queries local PDFs using Vector Databases (ChromaDB/Pinecone) and frameworks like LangChain.
3. **Agentic AI:** Developing autonomous teams of AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks using CrewAI or LangGraph.
4. **Production Engineering:** Moving from Jupyter Notebooks to production by containerizing applications with Docker and exposing them via FastAPI.

## 📂 Repository Structure
*(This section will be populated with links to specific project folders as they are completed)*
* `/01_data_manipulation` - EDA Notebooks and data cleaning scripts.
* `/02_applied_ml` - Predictive models and evaluation metrics.
* `/03_rag_systems` - LLM and Document Assistant implementations.
* `/04_agentic_production` - Dockerized AI Agent projects.
