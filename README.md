# 🧠 AI Mastery Journey: From Basics to Agentic AI

Welcome to my central repository. [cite_start]This space is a public learning log tracking my 16-week intensive roadmap to master Artificial Intelligence. [cite_start]My ultimate goal is to evolve from running basic local scripts to building robust "Production AI" and autonomous "AI Agents".

## 📚 Skills Acquired (Foundation)
* [cite_start]**Core Concepts:** Strong understanding of what AI is, along with its current limitations[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Python syntax, logic, and basic data manipulation[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Version Control:** Managing projects through Git and GitHub[cite: 9].

## ⚙️ Current Focus (In Progress)
* [cite_start]**Data Manipulation:** Learning to extract, clean, and transform complex datasets using Pandas[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Mathematical Intuition:** Building a solid visual understanding of vectors, matrices, and gradients (Linear Algebra & Calculus) [cite: 14, 15] [cite_start]to properly debug deep models later[cite: 46].

## 🚀 Roadmap: Skills to be Implemented
As I progress through my learning path, I will build and upload projects focusing on these advanced areas:
1. [cite_start]**Applied ML & Evaluation:** Shifting focus from basic algorithms to Cross-Validation and robust metrics (F1-Score, Precision/Recall)[cite: 25].
2. [cite_start]**Generative AI & RAG:** Building an Enterprise Document Assistant that queries local PDFs using Vector Databases (ChromaDB/Pinecone) and frameworks like LangChain[cite: 32, 33].
3. [cite_start]**Agentic AI:** Developing autonomous teams of AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks using CrewAI or LangGraph[cite: 37].
4. [cite_start]**Production Engineering:** Moving from Jupyter Notebooks to production by containerizing applications with Docker and exposing them via FastAPI[cite: 38].

## 📂 Repository Structure
*(This section will be populated with links to specific project folders as they are completed)*
* `/01_data_manipulation` - EDA Notebooks and data cleaning scripts.
* `/02_applied_ml` - Predictive models and evaluation metrics.
* `/03_rag_systems` - LLM and Document Assistant implementations.
* `/04_agentic_production` - Dockerized AI Agent projects.
